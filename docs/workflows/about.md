# Inference Workflows

## What is a Workflow?

Workflows allow you to define multi-step processes that run one or more models to return results based on model outputs and custom logic.

With Workflows, you can:

- Detect, classify, and segment objects in images.
- Apply logic filters such as establish detection consensus or filter detections by confidence.
- Use Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to make determinations at any stage in a workflow.

You can build and configure Workflows in the Roboflow web interface that you can then deploy using the Roboflow Hosted API, self-host locally and on the cloud using inference, or offline to your hardware devices. You can also build more advanced workflows by writing a Workflow configuration directly in the JSON editor.

In this section of documentation, we walk through what you need to know to create and run workflows. Letâ€™s get started!
